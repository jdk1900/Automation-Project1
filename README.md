# Automation-Project1

In this solution I demonstrate how to use Group Variables in YAML pipeline and more importantly how to create them without using the DevOps GUI but only with a PowerShell script and an API as part of the automation process. Also, how and why to create a manual Service Principal instead of automatic,what are the predefined variables in Azure DevOps and what benefit can we have by using them and finally how to override ARM parameters and add stages in a #pipeline .
The solution includes the following steps:

1.create an manual SP with Bash using cloud shell
2.create the YAML Pipeline with stages
3.override ARM parameters in the YAML
4.use Azure DevOps predefined variables
5.create a PowerShell script using functions to create Variable Groups in Azure DevOps Library
6.create a PAT (personal Access Token)
